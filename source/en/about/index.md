## Who is LFBearï¼Ÿ

I've been a total internet nerd since 2001. In 2003, I decided to change my online alias to "Xiao Feixiong," and I think I was the first person to ever do that! After college in 2008, I've been coding away. I've had a bunch of different job titles, but being a Software Engineer is definitely my favorite.


## Hobbies

I loves to geek out over new and cool stuff.

## What did I do

- High School: Driven by a passion for programming, I initiated "Little Bear Studio," a club where we created fun and practical VB applications, exploring topics from mathematics to cryptography.
- University: Continued my software development journey, building more complex systems like "Bobtail-Bear 2006" and experimenting with PHP frameworks.
- Work Experience:
    + Gained industry experience at Sina, transitioning from frontend to backend development and eventually leading teams.
    + Embraced the fast-paced startup environment, leading cloud-native initiatives and driving innovation in DevOps.
    + Expanded my horizons by working in an overseas company, deepening my understanding of global technology trends.
    + Current: **CONFIDENTIAL**
- Entrepreneurship: Ventured into entrepreneurship, launching startups in O2O and IoT to test my entrepreneurial skills.

## Long time no see, my blog.

Hi, I'm Little Flyer Bear (lfbear). Welcome to my lair. This a place where Iâ€™ll post some of my own feelings and some technical articles.

It's been a while since my last post. Sometimes, I think about how I've changed. I don't feel the need to say everything that comes to mind anymore. I don't like the idea of being "mature" because it means I'm no longer young, but I guess it's true.

I have so much to share about my life and work abroad over the past two years. It was tiring at times, but I learned a lot. The most important thing is that I gained a better understanding of different cultures and why people from different backgrounds think and act the way they do. By trying to see things from a different perspective, I realized that many questions I had before no longer bothered me. It's a relief.

Everyone in my family feels happier and more successful than before. I continue to believe that the unknown isn't always a bad thing. It's important to face it head-on.
